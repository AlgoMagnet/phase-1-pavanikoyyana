           int height; (For integers)
           float k_n; (For floating point numbers)
           char word1; (For characters)
           
***comments are optional , comments are used so that we can understand the code more precisely***
           
           // single line comment//
           /* for
             multiple line

           printf("Enter a number : %d", t);
 
 * %d , %f , %c are the format specifiers .

           %d for integers
           %f for floating values
           %c for characters
## ***scanf***

* to take user input at run time.

          scanf("%d",&t);
