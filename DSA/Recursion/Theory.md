# RECURSION
  
  * When a functon calls itself from within its body is called as ***recursive function*** .
  
  * The corresponding process is called as ***recursion .
  
  * A recursive algorithm contains a ***base condition*** .
  
  * That algorithm calls itself recursively .
  
  * The base condition decides how many times a recursive function should 
  
    call itself.
